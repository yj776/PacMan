# GhostMan

This GhostMan game is inspired by the traditional PacMan game with different characters and slightly different rules. This is a very basic version, more functionalities will be added in the future. 

The idea of the game is to stay away from Goku, a ghost killer in this case, for as long as possible. The goal is to survive. Highest Score (Survivial Time) will be recorded. At this time, it will only be a reference. In the future version, highest score will be saved. 

Each Goku is moving at a different speed and starts off at a different position. Move the Red Ghost with W,S,A,D key to move the character up, down, left, right.
